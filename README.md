### MapBox Geocoding API:

The Mapbox Geocoding API allows users to do forward geocoding operations. Forward Geocoding takes text in the form of an address or place and converts it to geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). This Api allows us to auto-load the address when searching for listing in specific locations.
